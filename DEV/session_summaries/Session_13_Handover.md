# Session 13 Handover

## 1. What We Did

- Pure design session. Zero code changes. Zero files modified.
- Reviewed `Ergonomics_Design_Report_v1.3.md` against project owner comments
  in `MY_COMMENTS.md`. Discussed every comment in detail.
- Verified three files against report claims: `keymap.json` (number-row keys
  confirmed inactive — no Digit bindings exist), `navigation.js` (Space
  confirmed unhandled and clean to add), `character-mode.js` (keyboard
  language warning gap confirmed — silent no-op when in English mode).
- Resolved all four open decisions carried over from Session 12.
- Added two new items: Shift+Tab backward jump, keyboard language warning.
- Produced `Ergonomics_Design_Report_v1.4.md` — fully standalone, supersedes
  v1.3. Does not reference any prior report.

## 2. Artefacts Produced

| File | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ergonomics_Design_Report_v1.4.md` | Final signed-off design report; standalone |

No source files were touched.

---

## 3. Key Decisions Locked

| Decision | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Single-key advance key | **Space** — thumb-operated; works from both Word Mode and Character Mode |
| Space in Word Mode | Alias for Tab — jumps to next undiacritized word |
| Space in Character Mode | Exits Character Mode + jumps to next undiacritized word in one keystroke |
| Backward jump | **Shift+Tab** — reverses Tab direction; universal CAT/IDE convention |
| Number-row layout | User's function-group scheme: column = vowel family (Fatha/Kasra/Dhamma), row = tier (plain/compound/tanween) |
| Numpad layout | Mirrors number row exactly — interchangeable muscle memory |
| Compound keys (Digit4/5/6) | **Deferred to Phase 2** — touch `character-mode.js` dangerous zone; edge-case behavior undefined |
| Keyboard language warning | Phase 1 — amber flash + non-blocking 2-second message when Latin key pressed in Character Mode |
| Character navigation (Arrow keys) | Retained as-is — CTRL+Space conflicts with Windows IME; no change this release |
| Customizable bindings | `keymap.json` is Phase 1 mechanism; VS Code-style UI is Phase 3 |

## 4. Current Project State

| Item | State |
| :--- | :--- |
| All Phases (1–5) | ✅ Complete and verified (unchanged) |
| v1.0.0 tag | ✅ Safe checkpoint (unchanged) |
| Runtime Folder Selector | ✅ Implemented (Session 10, unchanged) |
| Ergonomics design report | ✅ Complete — `Ergonomics_Design_Report_v1.4.md` |
| Ergonomic model script | ✅ Complete — `ergonomic_model.py` (unchanged) |
| Phase 1 implementation | 🔲 Not started — blocked on implementation plan review (Session 14) |
| `.gitignore` | ⚠ `config.json` entry still must be added (open since Session 10) |

---

## 5. Next Session Work Items

1. **Review the Phase 1 implementation plan** (report §10) and make it
   robust enough to hand to a coder:
   - Confirm exact file, function, and line-level change for each Phase 1 item.
   - Confirm order of changes and verification step between each.
   - Resolve whether to run `ergonomic_model.py` on additional sample docs
     before coding (open decision §11, item 1).
2. **Once the plan is locked**, implementation order per RULES.md §0:
   - `keymap.json` rearrangement (zero risk, do first).
   - Number-row aliases in `keymap.json`.
   - Shift+modifier support in keymap handler.
   - Space (single-key advance) in `navigation.js` + `character-mode.js`.
   - Shift+Tab (backward jump) in `navigation.js`.
   - Keyboard language warning in `character-mode.js`.
   - Update `?` overlay.
   - Add `config.json` to `.gitignore`.

---

## 6. Known Issues / Watch Points

- **1 open decision** (report §11, item 1): run `ergonomic_model.py` on
  additional sample docs before coding? Resolve at start of Session 14.
- **1 open decision** (report §11, item 2): compound key edge-case behavior
  — Phase 2 only, no urgency.
- **`.gitignore`** — `config.json` remains un-gitignored. Risk of accidental
  commit is live.
- **All Session 10 watch points remain open:** `?` key on Arabic keyboard
  layouts; `classifyAllWords()` performance on large files; completion banner
  z-index; plan/spec files deleted from working tree.

## Session Handover Protocol

This section is the standing protocol for all future sessions. Do not remove it
from any handover document — always include it in full.

At the end of every session, produce a Session_N_Handover.md file before
closing. The file must fit on one page and cover: (1) What we did, (2) Artefacts
produced, (3) Key decisions locked, (4) Current project state, (5) Next session
work items, (6) Known issues / watch points.

Rules: One page. Cut prose, not coverage. Do not count this protocol block
toward the page limit — always include it in full. Produce the handover even if
the session ended early or a phase was abandoned mid-way. The handover replaces
memory — write it as if handing off to someone who has the plan and spec but has
never seen the session conversation. File naming: Session_N_Handover.md where N
increments per session. The incoming session must read the latest handover plus
RULES.md before doing anything else. If none are attached, ask for them
explicitly before proceeding. Keep all handover files alongside the project
source files.
